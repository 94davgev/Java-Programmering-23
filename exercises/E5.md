# Exercises - Lecture 5 - Arrays

<ol>
<li><b>Arrays in jshell</b><br>
Launch jshell and perform the following tasks:
<ol type="a">
<li>Declare an array of strings called <code>fruits</code> and initialize it with the values "apple", "banana", "orange", "grape".</li>
<li>Print the length of the array.</li>
<li>Add a new fruit "kiwi" to the end of the array.</li>
<li>Print the updated array.</li>
<li>Replace the fruit at index 1 with "pear".</li>
<li>Print the final array.</li>
</ol></li><br>

<li><b>Array Searching</b><br>
Launch jshell and perform the following tasks:
<ol type="a">
<li>Declare an array of integers called numbers and initialize it with the values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.</li>
<li>Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in a variable called searchNumber.</li>
<li>Use a loop to search for searchNumber in the array. If found, print "Number found!" and break the loop. If not found, print "Number not found!".</li>
</ol></li><br>

<li><b>Array Manipulation with Objects</b><br>
Write a Java program that creates an array of custom objects and performs operations on them. Create a class called Person with properties like name and age. Initialize an array of Person objects with some sample data. Your program should perform operations like searching for a specific person, sorting the array based on age, and displaying the sorted array.
</li><br>

<li><b>Array of Dates</b><br>
Write a Java program that operates on an array of java.util.Date objects. Initialize an array with some random dates. Your program should find the earliest and latest dates in the array and calculate the time difference between them.
</li><br>

<li><b>Array of Words</b><br>
Write a Java program that works with an array of words. Initialize an array with a few words of your choice. Your program should find the longest word in the array, count the number of vowels in each word, and sort the array in alphabetical order.
</li><br>

<li><b>Playlist manager</b><br>
Create a package named "music" that contains two classes: "Song" and "Playlist." The Song class should have properties like title, artist, and duration. The Playlist class should have methods to add songs, remove songs, and display the total duration of the playlist.  

In a separate class, named "MusicApp," write a main method. Import the "music" package and create objects of both the Song and Playlist classes. Add multiple songs to the playlist and display the total duration of the playlist.
</li><br>

<li><b>Library catalog</b><br>
Create a package named "library" that contains two classes: "Book" and "LibraryCatalog." The Book class should have properties like title, author, and publication year. The LibraryCatalog class should have methods to add books, search books by title or author, and display all books in the catalog.  

In a separate class, named "LibraryApp," write a main method. Import the "library" package and create objects of both the Book and LibraryCatalog classes. Add multiple books to the catalog and perform search operations by title or author. Display the information of the books found in the search results.
