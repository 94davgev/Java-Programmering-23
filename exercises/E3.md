# Exercises - Lecture 3 - Classes

<ol>

<li> Create a class called myCalculator that computes three things within its main() method and then prints them to terminal:
<ol type="a">
<li> the area of a triangle </li>

<li> conversion of a temperature measurement from degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit </li>

<li> a check if a number is odd or even </li>
</ol></li><br>

<li> Expand myCalculator such that it takes user input for its calculations using <code>Scanner</code> </li><br>

<li>Let's make use of our imagination! Remember, coding is not just a technical process, it is also a very creative process. Let's practice creating things from minimal instructions.<ol type="a">
<li> Create a new .java-file with a class that describes a physical object of some kind, e.g. a person, an animal, an airplane, etc. Declare three variables of three different types associated with your object. Initialize them with reasonable values. </li>

<li> Create a main() method in your class, where you declare a new reference variable of your class type, and then instantiate a new object of the type and assign it to the variable. Add one or multiple print statements that prints the properties of your object to the terminal.</li>

<li> Create another .java-file that defines a vessel for your objects, e.g. a ship, a zoo, an airport, etc. Inside of it, declare <code>main()</code> and create two new separate instances of your class from 2.1. Print the reference values to the terminal.</li>

<li> Create a third variable of your type, and assign it with variable 1. Print all three reference values to the terminal. What is the result? Why? </li>
<li> Re-assign the values of variable 1. Observe what happens to the values of variables 2 and 3. Explain the behaviour. </li>
</ol></li><br>

# Constructors
<ol>
<li><b>Student Class</b><br>
Create a Student class with the following properties: name (String), age (int), and grade (double). Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes all the properties. Create an instance of the Student class with sample values and print the details.
</li><br>

<li><b>Book Class</b><br>
Create a Book class with the following properties: title (String), author (String), and year (int). Implement a parameterless constructor that initializes the properties with default values. Create an instance of the Book class using the default constructor and print the details.
</li><br>

<li><b>Car Class</b><br>
Create a Car class with the following properties: make (String), model (String), year (int), and color (String). Implement multiple constructors, including a parameterized constructor and constructor chaining. Create instances of the Car class using different constructors and print the details.
</li><br>

<li>Go back to your class from the exercise 3 in the "Classes" segment above and create chained constructors for your class. Use these constructors to create new objects in your vessel class.</li>
